      I have 13 years of graphic design experience in the printing industry and recently added app development to my skill set.

     I Can't agree more. This is one of the reasons that I want to do app development. 
     Within half a year, I have already built several apps. Coding is full of fun and challenges. 
     It is like a miniature of life. Many of the times when your code is not working, you'd feel so frustrated. 
     Never give up and continue to learn, eventually, you will find the solution for any problem and you will be successful!
