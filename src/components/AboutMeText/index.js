    I had worked as a graphic designer for 13 years in Hong Kong. In June 2019, I moved and started my new life in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, Vancouver!
     <br /> 
     <br />
     Not only that I am having my new life in Vancouver, but also I am expanding my skill sets and transforming myself into an app developer!  
     Within half a year, I have already built several apps. Coding is full of challenges. 
     It is like a miniature of life. Many of the times when your code is not working, you'd feel so frustrated. 
     Never give up and continue to learn, eventually, you will find the solution for any problem and you will be successful!
